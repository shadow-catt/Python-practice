The natural law theory is a theory of ethics that  holds that there are moral laws found in nature and  discernable by the use of reason. The way the term  is used in discussions of ethics should not be confused with those other ¡°laws of nature¡± that are the  generalizations of natural science. The laws of natural science are descriptive laws. They describe how  nature behaves. Gases, for example, expand with  their containers and when heat is applied. Boyle¡¯s  law about the behavior of gases does not tell gases  how they ought to behave. In fact, if gases were found to behave differently from what we had so far  observed, then the laws would be changed to match  this new information. Simply put, scientific laws are  descriptive generalizations of fact. Moral laws, on the other hand, are prescriptive laws. They tell us how we ought to behave. The natural law is the moral law written into nature itself.  What we ought to do, according to this theory, is  determined by considering certain aspects of nature.  In particular, we ought to examine our nature as  human beings to see what is essential for us to function well as members of our species. We look to certain aspects of our nature to know what is good and  what we ought to do.
